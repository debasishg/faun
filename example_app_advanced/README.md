# Advanced E-commerce Analytics Example

This example implements the comprehensive "Real-World Example" from the main README, demonstrating how to build a complete e-commerce order processing and analytics system using the SoA framework.

## What This Example Demonstrates

### 🏗️ Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles
- **Rich Domain Models**: `Order` entity with business logic and behavior
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Business terminology used throughout the code
- **Domain Services**: `OrderAnalytics` service encapsulating business operations
- **Type Safety**: Strong types for `OrderStatus` and `PaymentMethod`

### ⚡ Structure of Arrays (SoA) Performance
- **Columnar Storage**: Automatic conversion to cache-friendly data layout
- **Efficient Filtering**: Fast queries on individual fields (status, payment method, etc.)
- **Bulk Operations**: High-performance aggregations and analytics
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better cache utilization and reduced memory bandwidth

### 📊 Business Analytics Features

The example includes realistic e-commerce analytics:

1. **Revenue Analysis**
   - Revenue by payment method
   - Total revenue calculations
   - Customer lifetime value

2. **Customer Intelligence**
   - Top customers by order volume
   - High-value customer detection
   - Customer segmentation

3. **Product Performance**
   - Sales volume by product
   - Revenue tracking
   - Delivery success rates

4. **Operational Insights**
   - Order status funnel analysis
   - Payment method distribution
   - Fraud detection patterns

5. **Time-Series Analytics**
   - Daily revenue trends
   - Order aging analysis
   - Performance over time

## Key Architecture Components

### Domain Layer
```rust
#[derive(SoA, SoAStore, Debug, Copy, Clone)]
#[soa_store(key = "order_id", shards = 16)]
pub struct Order {
    // Rich domain model with business fields
    pub order_id: u64,
    pub customer_id: u64,
    pub total_amount: f64,
    pub status: OrderStatus,
    // ... more fields
}
```

### Business Logic Layer
```rust
impl Order {
    pub fn new(...) -> Self { /* Domain object creation */ }
    pub fn revenue(&self) -> f64 { /* Business rules */ }
}
```

### Service Layer
```rust
pub struct OrderAnalytics {
    store: OrderStore,  // SoA-optimized storage
}

impl OrderAnalytics {
    // High-level business operations
    pub fn revenue_by_payment_method(&self) -> HashMap<PaymentMethod, f64>
    pub fn top_customers_by_volume(&self, limit: usize) -> Vec<(u64, u32)>
    // ... more analytics
}
```

## Running the Example

```bash
# Build and run the advanced example
cargo run --bin example_app_advanced

# Or from the workspace root
cargo run --package example_app_advanced
```

## Expected Output

The example generates comprehensive analytics output showing:

- Revenue breakdown by payment method
- Customer analysis with lifetime values
- Order status funnel metrics
- Product performance statistics
- High-value customer identification
- Fraud detection results
- Daily revenue trends

## Performance Characteristics

This example benefits from SoA's performance advantages:

- **Cache-Efficient**: Queries access only needed columns
- **SIMD-Friendly**: Homogeneous data types enable vectorization
- **Memory Efficient**: Reduced memory bandwidth usage
- **Scalable**: Sharded storage (16 shards) for concurrent access

## Comparison with Basic Example

| Aspect | Basic Example | Advanced Example |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Domain Model** | Simple struct | Rich domain entity with behavior |
| **Business Logic** | Basic operations | Complex analytics and insights |
| **Data Volume** | Small dataset | Realistic e-commerce scenarios |
| **Query Complexity** | Simple filters | Multi-dimensional analysis |
| **Use Case** | Learning/Demo | Production-ready patterns |

## Key Lessons

1. **Domain-First Design**: Start with business concepts, let SoA optimize performance
2. **Clean Abstractions**: Business logic remains unchanged despite SoA optimization
3. **Performance by Design**: Architectural decisions enable both clarity and speed
4. **Empirical Validation**: Always measure performance in realistic scenarios

## Next Steps

To extend this example:

1. **Add Parallel Processing**: Use the `parallel` feature with Rayon
2. **Implement Caching**: Add memoization for expensive calculations
3. **Add Persistence**: Integrate with databases or file systems
4. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize shard counts and access patterns
5. **Business Rules**: Add more complex domain logic and validations

This example serves as a template for building high-performance, domain-rich applications using the SoA framework.
